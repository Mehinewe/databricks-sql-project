# 📊 Sales & Customer Insights Analytics Project (Databricks SQL)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an analytics workflow built in Databricks SQL 
transforming transactional data into business-ready, decision-support dashboards.

But this wasn’t just a technical exercise.
The goal was to answer a fundamental question:
How can we turn data into clarity for decision-makers?

The final deliverable includes two interactive dashboards:
* Sales Performance Dashboard – Built for leadership visibility
* Customer Insights Dashboard – Built for segmentation and strategy

## 🧠 The Business Context

Many organizations collect large volumes of sales and customer data, but struggle to:
* Understand performance trends
* Identify high-value customers
* Segment their audience effectively
* Translate metrics into strategic action

This project bridges that gap.
Instead of focusing only on SQL queries, I focused on:

* Defining meaningful KPIs
* Validating insights with business logic
* Designing dashboards for specific audiences
* Making analytics self-service

### 🔎 Step 1: Data Exploration in Databricks SQL
Before building dashboards, I performed structured exploratory analysis directly in Databricks SQL:
* Validated joins between fact and dimension tables
* Checked data completeness and consistency
* Analyzed sales distribution across time and categories
* Identified customer segmentation patterns
* Measured revenue concentration across customers

**SQL techniques used:**
* Aggregations
* Window functions
* Multi-table joins
* Date filtering logic
This phase ensured that every metric used in the dashboards was accurate, defensible, and business-aligned.

## 📊 Dashboard 1: Sales Performance
### 🎯 Purpose
Provide executives and sales managers with a clear, high-level view of business performance.

### 💡 Business Questions Answered

* Are we growing or declining over time?
* Which product categories drive the most revenue?
* Are we generating profit or just sales volume?
* How does performance change across selected time periods?
This dashboard enables fast, executive-level decision-making without requiring SQL knowledge.

## 👥 Dashboard 2: Customer Insights
### 🎯 Purpose
Support marketing and strategy teams in understanding customer behavior and segmentation.

### 💎 Business Questions Answered
* Understanding Our Customers
* How many active consumers do we have?
* What is the average revenue per customer?
* Which age groups generate the most orders?
* How does purchasing behavior vary by country?
* Identifying High-Value Customers
* Who are our top 10 revenue-generating customers?
* How concentrated is our revenue?
* Which customers should be prioritized for retention?
This dashboard transforms transactional data into strategic intelligence.

## 🤝 Business Validation Process
To ensure insights were meaningful and actionable:
* KPIs were aligned with business definitions
* Naming conventions were refined for clarity
* Dashboard layout was adjusted for usability
This process ensured that the final dashboards were not just technically correct — but business-relevant.

## 🎨 Dashboard Design Philosophy
I intentionally designed two separate dashboards because:
* Executives need clarity and high-level KPIs
* Marketing teams need segmentation and detail

## 🤖 How AI Enhanced My Workflow
AI was used as a productivity and reasoning partner throughout the project.
It helped to:
* Optimize SQL queries
* Explore alternative metrics
* Validate assumptions
* Speed up exploratory analysis
* Improve documentation and storytelling
AI did not replace analytical thinking — it enhanced iteration speed and insight generation.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
* SQL is more powerful when aligned with business context
* Dashboards should be audience-specific
* Data exploration is critical before visualization
* Validation with stakeholders increases insight credibility
* AI can significantly enhance analytical workflows
